                <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
            </a>

                <img src="images/affinity.png">
            </a>
            <p>My affinity diagram contains 5 categories: Amenities and Comfort, Screen and Sound Quality, Pricing and Discounts, Movie Selection and Showtimes, and Location and Atmosphere.
                Each category contains 4 ideas, totalling to 20 ideas overal. The process of creating the diagram allowed me to brain storm and bring my final project into focus.

            <p>These six images were generated by Canva AI. Three are of an app and three are of a wesite. They represent a place where users can go to look at detailed reviews of local Columbia, SC movie theaters. They can look at text and video reviews, and there are links to Google reviews and maps for each theater.</p>
